### Project Overview  

- I collected doctors from this site [https://doctors.nyp.org/?aff=false](https://doctors.nyp.org/?aff=false) 
- I mimicked  some of  their design as well, to make it more of a compliment application to their already existing applications. 

### Local Deployment

Assuming that you have Git installed on your computer, to run this application on your local device you can clone this repo and then navigate to cedar-take-home/front-end. 
Assuming that you have Node.js  running on your device you can then run the command “npm install” to download all node packages. Then finally  “npm start”. The back end is hosted on Heroku so you do not need to run it locally.
